            <p> My name is David Benton, but all my friends call me Shelby. I am named after Shelby Carol the car legend. My dad used to own a Daytona Shelby, but when I was born he had to find a more practical vehicle. He wasn't able to forget about his car though, and thus nicknamed me after it, so that he could have something to remember it by.</p>
